//Add force at position
//Drag modes(square, liniar,constant ,inverse)
//Circle collider
//Line Collider
inverse mass efficiency
colliders in single variable
Get all colliders of an object
possibly physics matirials
//rotations in collisions
//friction

MAKE SURE LOCAL SPACE WORKS ESPECIALLY VELOCITY

//Add child search methods(childrenCount, isChild, decendentsCount, isDecentant)

Add scene save and load
//Orgenize search methods in scene class
